# About me

I'm a technical consultant for machine learning, mainly interested in risk management applications,
fraud prevention and behavioural analytics, but not only, any good challenge is welcome!

In my past, I've led a development team for PayPal dealing with technical solutions for seller risk management,
and co-founded Wonga's risk management site in Tel-Aviv to tackle fraudsters in the personal loans business.

I'm pretty agile, a fast learner who doesn't use the word "can't" much. Although I've built fully production
systems in my past with many technologies and dev-ops constraints, I'm generally more attracted to data-related
projects, prototyping some revolutionary ideas and anything that can ignite my imagination.

I'm a very big fun of all kind of MOOCs and do everything I can to find some time for at least one Coursera/Edx/Udacity course at any given time. Their subjects vary from [Deep Learning](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/),
[Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization),
[Astrophysics](https://www.edx.org/course/astrophysics-violent-universe-anux-anu-astro3x-0),
[Music Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/edinburgh-music-theory)
and even [History](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2).
All courses linked above are highly recommended!

My favorite post in the website is [Generating Random Polygons](/2015/11/11/random-polygons.html). It started as a sub task for something else and I absolutely didn't expect it to take that much time. Unfortunately, no-one really searches Google for 'random polygons', and so it is one of the least viewed pages on my site. I still like it! 

Don't hesitate emailing or skyping, I don't bite and if I'm available I'd love to have a chat on almost anything interesting!
