    I mainly look for content mistakes, better phrasing or just things that are unclear and could have been explained better. The easiest way to comment is by just highlighting the text (it uses Hypothes.is and requires an account there). If for any reason you don't want to use it, please feel to email me directly at zachmoshe@gmail.com.
