I'm a skilled software developer, driven by data and challenges, with experience and interest in the area of online fraud prevention. In my past roles I've been leading a development team at PayPal, was the head of development at CapitalCadence (startup company) and today I'm a Software Developer Manager for fraud prevention at Wonga. I love data, love drilling down and mining insights from it but more than that I love bringing insights to the real world and build actual solutions with them.

The idea to write a tech blog started running through my mind about a year ago. I sometimes find myself running experiments, checking an algorithm or playing with a new technology just for the fun of it (as I'm pretty sure many of the readers of this blog do) and thought that it would be great to summarize each "project" and put it somewhere to share with others. The idea was somehow neglected until about a month ago. I had to use ruby gems in an HadoopStreaming mapper on EMR  and had to go through many blogs, stackoverflow questions and tutorials to get everything to work. That was when I decided that my first post will summarize that.

This blog will mainly be on stuff that I do at my free time. Can't commit on topics, but I guess interesting data sources will get their posts, as well as experiences that I had with data mining technology.

Feel free to reach out to me on any subject:

<div class="custom-links">
      {% for social in site.social %}
        {% if social.url %}
            <a class="icon-{{ social.icon }}" href="{{ social.url }}"><i class="fa fa-{{ social.icon }}"></i></a>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
</div>

Hope you'll enjoy it!
